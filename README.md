# Transcriptomic analysis of RNA-Seq data using DESeq2

I have analysed 30 thyroid samples with different degrees of infiltration: no infiltration (NIT), small infiltration (SFI) and large infiltration (ELI), and compared the differential transcription patterns of these three conditions in pairs, the results show an overexpression of genes involved in the activation of the immune system in tissues with a higher degree of infiltration, suggesting a possible infection in the patient or a gene deregulation in these tissues.
